        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>Like many people after high school I was not certain what I wanted to do. Initially, I considered becoming a pilot but whilst it was fun it didn't feel like the right thing. So afterwards I tried doing a few different things, basic low-skilled work etc.</p>
        <p>Eventually I decided I wanted to do something that interested me at University. I did a Bachelor of Arts majoring in International Relations and minoring in Classical studies. To make up the other points I did a little bit other of Arts subjects such as philosophy and anthropology to broaden my knowledge into some other subjects. This taught me a lot about the world and gave me a lot of confidence in myself as I managed rather well. </p>
        <p>After finishing my degree I started to consider working in tech. My brother and friend both were in the field and I was highly attracted to the prospect of joining the field and creating websites. I had also realised that whilst I may enjoy International relations I wanted to create interactable things like websites. So I applied for Dev Academy and was fortunate to be accepted. I survived this Bootcamp and so now I'm looking to start my programming career.</p>
