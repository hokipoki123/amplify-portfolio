      <p>Firstly there is of course this portfolio I have been working on. It is basic but I wanted to show I can create something.</p>
      <p>Another project I worked on was a week-long group project at Dev Academy which we called Wellington on a Beach. The premise was that we wanted a website showing which Wellington beach was worth swimming at on a given day. The APIs may or may not be working simply due to the cost of calling the APIs. Within this project, I focused a lot on linking things together, particularly in both the frontend and backend. I also ended up being an impromptu scrum master which was interesting, particularly when trying to prevent the people working on CSS from over fixating.</p>
